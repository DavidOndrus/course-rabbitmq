# Marketplace backend

## Documentation

Is in `docs` folder.

AsyncAPI spec is in `asyncapi.yaml`, the HTML output (`asyncapi.html`) can be generated with AsyncAPI CLI with HTML template - DO NOT edit this file directly.

## Local development

Start services with `docker compose up`.

## Tips: What to do next

- enhance AsyncAPI spec with receive operations (currently there are only send operations)
- implement another system event in the form of AMQP message, e.g. `account.won`
  - feathers-accounts will be the publisher of this message
  - feathers-notifications will be the subscriber of this message
  - event will happen when loyalty account reaches 1000 points
  - email notification will be sent to the user with some discount code
